`paqet` is a bidirectional packet level proxy built using raw sockets in Go. It forwards traffic from a local client to a remote server, which then connects to target services. By operating at the packet level, it completely bypasses the host operating system's TCP/IP stack, using KCP for secure, reliable transport.

## Key Features

- **High-Performance Transport**: Uses KCP over raw TCP packets, bypassing the OS TCP/IP stack.
- **Advanced Obfuscation**:
  - **Padding**: Randomizes packet lengths to hide protocol signatures.
  - **Header Randomization**: Mimics various OS fingerprints (TTL, TOS, Window Size).
  - **TLS Record Obfuscation**: Wraps traffic in TLS records to blend in with HTTPS.
- **Port Hopping**: Dynamically rotates destination ports to evade flow-based blocking and analysis.
- **eBPF (XDP) Support**: Optional high-performance driver for Linux using XDP for packet capture and AF_PACKET for injection, minimizing CPU usage.
- **Multi-Server Support**: Client supports simultaneous connections to multiple upstream servers for redundancy.
- **Firewall Management**: Built-in CLI (`paqet iptables`) to manage required firewall rules safely.

> **⚠️ Development Status Notice**
>
> This project is in **active development**. APIs, configuration formats, and interfaces may change without notice. Use with caution in production environments.

This project serves as an example of low-level network programming in Go, demonstrating concepts like:

- High-performance packet capture with eBPF (XDP) and `pcap`.
- Raw packet crafting and injection with `gopacket`.
- Packet capture with `pcap`.
- Custom binary network protocols.
- The security implications of operating below the standard OS firewall.

## Use Cases and Motivation

`paqet` use cases include bypassing firewalls that detect standard handshake protocols and kernel-level connection tracking, as well as network security research. While more complex to configure than general-purpose VPN solutions, it offers granular control at the packet level.

## How It Works

`paqet` captures packets using `pcap` or `eBPF` (on Linux) and injects crafted TCP packets containing encrypted transport data. KCP provides reliable, encrypted communication optimized for high-loss networks using aggressive retransmission, forward error correction, and symmetric encryption.

```
[Your App] <------> [paqet Client] <===== Raw TCP Packet =====> [paqet Server] <------> [Target Server]
(e.g. curl)        (localhost:1080)        (Internet)          (Public IP:PORT)     (e.g. https://httpbin.org)
```

The system operates in three layers: raw TCP packet injection, encrypted transport (KCP), and application-level connection multiplexing.

KCP provides reliable, encrypted communication optimized for high-loss or unpredictable networks, using aggressive retransmission, forward error correction, and symmetric encryption with a shared secret key. It is especially well-suited for real-time applications and gaming where low latency are critical.

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build `paqet` yourself, follow these instructions.

### Linux

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.25+
- `libpcap` development headers
- `clang`, `llvm`, `libbpf-dev` (for eBPF compilation)

```bash
# Install dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install build-essential libpcap-dev clang llvm libbpf-dev

# Generate eBPF artifacts
go generate ./internal/socket/ebpf

# Build
go build -o paqet ./cmd
```

#### Building without libpcap (eBPF only):
If you want to run paqet on a system without libpcap installed, you can build a version that only supports the ebpf driver.
```bash
go build -tags nopcap -o paqet_nopcap ./cmd
```

### Windows

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.25+
- Npcap (ensure "WinPcap API-compatible Mode" is checked during installation)
- GCC (MinGW-w64)

```powershell
# Build (eBPF is skipped on Windows)
go build -o paq.exe ./cmd
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `libpcap` development libraries must be installed on both the client and server machines.
  - **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev`
  - **RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:** `sudo yum install libpcap-devel`
  - **macOS:** Comes pre-installed with Xcode Command Line Tools. Install with `xcode-select --install`
  - **Windows:** Install Npcap. Download from [npcap.com](https://npcap.com/).

- **eBPF Requirements (Linux only):**
  - **Kernel:** Linux 5.8+ is required (5.15+ recommended for optimal performance).
  - **Usage:** Set `driver: "ebpf"` in `config.yaml`.
  - **Build Dependencies:** If building from source, `clang`, `llvm`, and `libbpf-dev` are required.
### 1. Download a Release

Download the pre-compiled binary for your client and server operating systems from the project's **Releases page**.

You will also need the configuration files from the `example/` directory.

### 2. Configure the Connection

paqet uses a unified configuration approach with role-based settings. Copy and modify either:

- `example/client.yaml.example` - Client configuration example
- `example/server.yaml.example` - Server configuration example

You must correctly set the interfaces, IP addresses, MAC addresses, and ports.

> **⚠️ Important:**
>
> - **Role Configuration**: Role must be explicitly set as `role: "client"` or `role: "server"`
> - **Transport Security**: KCP requires identical keys on client/server.
> - **Configuration**: See "Critical Configuration Points" section below for detailed security requirements

#### Finding Your Network Details

You'll need to find your network interface name, local IP, and the MAC address of your network's gateway (router).

**On Linux:**

1.  **Find Interface and Local IP:** Run `ip a`. Look for your primary network card (e.g., `eth0`, `ens3`). Its IP address is listed under `inet`.
2.  **Find Gateway MAC:**
    - First, find your gateway's IP: `ip r | grep default`
    - Then, find its MAC address with `arp -n <gateway_ip>` (e.g., `arp -n 192.168.1.1`).

**On macOS:**

1.  **Find Interface and Local IP:** Run `ifconfig`. Look for your primary interface (e.g., `en0`). Its IP is listed under `inet`.
2.  **Find Gateway MAC:**
    - First, find your gateway's IP: `netstat -rn | grep default`
    - Then, find its MAC address with `arp -n <gateway_ip>` (e.g., `arp -n 192.168.1.1`).

**On Windows:**

1. **Find Interface and Local IP:** Run `ipconfig /all` and note your active network adapter (Ethernet or Wi-Fi):
   - Its **IP Address**
   - The **Gateway IP Address**
2. **Find Interface device GUID:** Windows requires the Npcap device GUID. In PowerShell, run `Get-NetAdapter | Select-Object Name, InterfaceGuid`. Note the **Name** and **InterfaceGuid** of your active network interface, and format the GUID as `\Device\NPF_{GUID}`.
3. **Find Gateway MAC Address:** Run: `arp -a <gateway_ip>`. Note the MAC address for the gateway.

#### Client Configuration - SOCKS5 Proxy Mode

The client acts as a SOCKS5 proxy server, accepting connections from applications and dynamically forwarding them through the raw TCP packets to any destination.

#### Example Client Configuration (`config.yaml`)

```yaml

  kcp:
    block: "aes" # Encryption algorithm

```

#### Critical Firewall Configuration

This application uses `pcap` or `eBPF` to receive and inject packets at a low level, **bypassing traditional firewalls like `ufw` or `firewalld`**.

**For `pcap` driver:** The OS kernel will still see incoming packets for the connection port and, not knowing about the connection, will generate TCP `RST` (reset) packets. This causes connection instability. You **must** configure `iptables` on the server to prevent this.

**For `ebpf` driver:** The XDP program uses `XDP_DROP` to discard incoming packets at the driver level, preventing them from reaching the kernel stack. Therefore, `iptables` rules are **not required** to prevent RST packets. However, applying them is recommended as a safety fallback in case the eBPF program fails to load or you switch drivers.

**Firewall Commands (Required for `pcap`, Optional for `ebpf`):**

Run these commands as root on your server:

```bash
# Replace <PORT> with your server listen port (e.g., 9999).
# NOTE: If using Port Hopping, you must apply these rules to ALL configured ports 
# and ranges. Repeat the commands for each port or range in your list.
# For ranges, use the start:end syntax (e.g., 20000:30000).

# 1. Bypass connection tracking (conntrack) for the connection port(s).
# This tells the kernel's netfilter to ignore packets on this port for state tracking.
sudo iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport <PORT> -j NOTRACK
sudo iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport <PORT> -j NOTRACK

# Example for a range:
# sudo iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 20000:30000 -j NOTRACK
# sudo iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 20000:30000 -j NOTRACK

# 2. Prevent the kernel from sending TCP RST packets that would kill the session.
# This drops any RST packets the kernel tries to send from the connection port.
sudo iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport <PORT> --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP

# Example for a range:
# sudo iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 20000:30000 --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP

# An alternative for rule 2 if issues persist:
sudo iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <PORT> -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport <PORT> -j ACCEPT

# To make rules persistent across reboots:
# Debian/Ubuntu: sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
# RHEL/CentOS: sudo service iptables save
```

These rules ensure that only the application handles traffic for the connection port.

> **⚠️ Important - Avoid Standard Ports:**
>
> Do not use ports 80, 443, or any other standard ports, because iptables rules can also affect outgoing connections from the server. Choose non-standard ports (e.g., 9999, 8888, or other high-numbered ports) for your server configuration.

### 3. Run `paqet`

Make the downloaded binary executable (`chmod +x ./paqet_linux_amd64`). You will need root privileges to use raw sockets.

**On the Server:**
_Place your server configuration file in the same directory as the binary and run:_

```bash
# Make sure to use the binary name you downloaded for your server's OS/Arch.
sudo ./paqet_linux_amd64 run -c config.yaml
```

**On the Client:**
_Place your client configuration file in the same directory as the binary and run:_

```bash
# Make sure to use the binary name you downloaded for your client's OS/Arch.
sudo ./paqet_darwin_arm64 run -c config.yaml
```

### 4. Test the Connection

Once the client and server are running, test the SOCKS5 proxy:

```bash
# Test with curl using the SOCKS5 proxy
curl -v https://httpbin.org/ip --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080
```

This request will be proxied over raw TCP packets to the server, and then forwarded according to the client mode configuration. The output should show your server's public IP address, confirming the connection is working.

## Command-Line Usage

`paqet` is a multi-command application. The primary command is `run`, which starts the proxy, but several utility commands are included to help with configuration and debugging.

The general syntax is:

```bash
sudo ./paqet <command> [arguments]
```

| Command   | Description                                                                      |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run`     | Starts the `paqet` client or server proxy. This is the main operational command. |
| `secret`  | Generates a new, cryptographically secure secret key.                            |
| `ping`    | Sends a single test packet to the server to verify connectivity .                |
| `dump`    | A diagnostic tool similar to `tcpdump` that captures and decodes packets.        |
| `version` | Prints the application's version information.                                    |

## Configuration Reference

paqet uses a unified YAML configuration that works for both clients and servers. The `role` field must be explicitly set to either `"client"` or `"server"`.

**For complete parameter documentation, see the example files:**

- [`example/client.yaml.example`](example/client.yaml.example) - Client configuration reference
- [`example/server.yaml.example`](example/server.yaml.example) - Server configuration reference

### Encryption Modes

The `transport.kcp.block` parameter determines the encryption method. There are two special modes to disable encryption:

**`none`** (Plaintext with Header)
No encryption is applied, but a protocol header is still present. The packet format remains compatible with encrypted modes, but the content is plaintext. This helps with protocol compatibility.

**`xor`** (XOR Encryption)
Extremely fast but cryptographically weak. When combined with **Padding**, it provides excellent performance and sufficient obfuscation to evade DPI that relies on pattern matching, as the traffic appears as high-entropy random noise. Recommended for high-speed links where the inner traffic is already encrypted (e.g., HTTPS).

**`null`** (Raw Data)
No encryption and no protocol header, data is transmitted in raw form without any cryptographic framing. This offers the highest performance but is the least secure and most easily identified.

### KCP Tuning

The `transport.kcp` section controls the KCP protocol behavior.

**Modes:**
- `normal`: Balanced settings (nodelay=0, interval=40, resend=2, nocongestion=1).
- `fast`: Optimized for low latency (nodelay=1, interval=30, resend=2, nocongestion=1).
- `fast2`: More aggressive (nodelay=1, interval=20, resend=2, nocongestion=1).
- `fast3`: Most aggressive (nodelay=1, interval=10, resend=2, nocongestion=1).
- `manual`: Use the specific parameters defined below.

**Manual Parameters (used when `mode: "manual"`):**
- `nodelay`: Enable nodelay mode (0=disable, 1=enable).
- `interval`: Protocol internal work interval in ms (10-5000). Lower is more responsive.
- `resend`: Fast retransmission trigger (0=off, 2=typical).
- `nocongestion`: Disable congestion control (1=disable, 0=enable).

### Port Hopping

`paqet` includes a Port Hopping feature to evade traffic analysis that targets long-lived connections on fixed ports.

- **Dynamic Rotation:** The client automatically rotates the destination port across user-configured ports or ranges (e.g., `80`, `443`, `20000-30000`) at a specified interval. This prevents the connection from looking like a single persistent flow.
- **Server Range Listening:** The server uses `pcap` filters to capture traffic across the entire port range without needing to bind thousands of sockets.
- **Port Echoing:** To ensure stability with NAT devices and stateful firewalls, the server replies from the exact port the client used for that specific packet, rather than a single fixed listen port.

To enable, configure the `hopping` section in both client and server YAML files.

### Multi-Server Support

The client configuration now supports a `servers` list, allowing you to define multiple upstream servers.

- **Redundancy & Distribution:** The client initializes connections to all configured servers simultaneously.
- **Per-Server Configuration:** Each server entry can have its own transport settings, hopping configuration, and forwarding rules.

### Traffic Obfuscation

`paqet` supports advanced traffic obfuscation to evade Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).

- **Padding:** Randomizes packet lengths to hide protocol signatures (e.g. KCP headers).
- **Header Randomization:** Randomizes IP/TCP headers (TOS, TTL, Window Size) to mimic various operating systems and blend in with normal traffic.
- **TLS Record Obfuscation:** Wraps packets in TLS Application Data records (Experimental/Not Recommended without handshake).

### Critical Configuration Points

**Transport Security:** KCP requires identical keys on client/server (use `secret` command to generate).

**Network Configuration:** Use your actual IP address in `network.ipv4.addr`, not `127.0.0.1`. For servers, `network.ipv4.addr` and `listen.addr` ports must match. For clients, use port `0` in `network.ipv4.addr` to automatically assign a random available port and avoid conflicts.

**TCP Flag Cycling:** The `network.tcp.local_flag` and `network.tcp.remote_flag` arrays cycle through flag combinations to vary traffic patterns. Common patterns: `["PA"]` (standard data), `["S"]` (connection setup), `["A"]` (acknowledgment).

# Architecture & Security Model

### The `pcap` Approach and Firewall Bypass

Understanding _why_ standard firewalls are bypassed is key to using this tool securely.

A normal application uses the OS's TCP/IP stack. When a packet arrives, it travels up the stack where `netfilter` (the backend for `ufw`/`firewalld`) inspects it. If a firewall rule blocks the port, the packet is dropped and never reaches the application.

```
      +------------------------+
      |   Normal Application   |  <-- Data is received here
      +------------------------+
                   ^
      +------------------------+
      |    OS TCP/IP Stack     |  <-- Firewall (netfilter) runs here
      |  (Connection Tracking) |
      +------------------------+
                   ^
      +------------------------+
      |     Network Driver     |
      +------------------------+
```

`paqet` uses `pcap` to hook in at a much lower level. It requests a **copy** of every packet directly from the network driver, _before_ the main OS TCP/IP stack and firewall get to process it.

```
      +------------------------+
      |    paqet Application   |  <-- Gets a packet copy immediately
      +------------------------+
              ^       \
 (pcap copy) /         \  (Original packet continues up)
            /           v
      +------------------------+
      |     OS TCP/IP Stack    |  <-- Firewall drops the *original* packet,
      |  (Connection Tracking) |      but paqet already has its copy.
      +------------------------+
                  ^
      +------------------------+
      |     Network Driver     |
      +------------------------+
```

This means a rule like `ufw deny <PORT>` will have no effect on the proxy's operation, as `paqet` receives and processes the packet before `ufw` can block it.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

This project is an exploration of low-level networking and carries significant security responsibilities. The KCP transport protocol provides encryption, authentication, and integrity using symmetric encryption with a shared secret key.

Security depends entirely on proper key management. Use the `secret` command to generate a strong key that must remain identical on both client and server.

## Troubleshooting

1.  **Permission Denied:** Ensure you are running with `sudo`.
2.  **Connection Times Out:**
    - **Transport Configuration Mismatch:**
      - **KCP**: Ensure `transport.kcp.key` is exactly identical on client and server
    - **`iptables` Rules:** Did you apply the firewall rules on the server?
    - **Incorrect Network Details:** Double-check all IPs, MAC addresses, and interface names.
    - **Cloud Provider Firewalls:** Ensure your cloud provider's security group allows TCP traffic on your `listen.addr` port.
    - **NAT/Port Configuration:** For servers, ensure `listen.addr` and `network.ipv4.addr` ports match. For clients, use port `0` in `network.ipv4.addr` for automatic port assignment to avoid conflicts.
    - **Port Range Overlap:** If using Port Hopping with a large range (e.g., `20000-40000`), ensure it does not overlap with your OS's ephemeral port range (Linux defaults to `32768-60999`).
      - **Symptom:** Logs showing `dropped invalid packet` from port 80/443.
      - **Fix:** Change your hopping range to `10000-30000` or adjust `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`.
3.  **Use `ping` and `dump`:** Use `paqet ping -c config.yaml` to test the connection. Use `paqet dump -p <PORT>` on the server to see if packets are arriving.
